# Dylan Polito Portfolio

## What is this project?
This project marks the beginning of my coding journey at UT Austin. This website serves as a portfolio of my current work and what I'll create in the future. I'll keep updating this website as I learn new skills and work on new projects.

As of 09/27/2023, I've used only HTML and CSS, but I plan to incorporate more technologies in the future.

Creating this website has been a valuable learning experience. I've discovered new animations and improved my coding to make the website more user-friendly and less cluttered.
